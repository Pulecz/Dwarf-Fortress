Replaces version in line "df_max_version": "0.42.05", to new defined version in all manifest.json files in ~/.dwarffortress-lnp-git/LNP/graphics' so the PyLNP allows to use the graphics pack

##Start
Don't freak out if you see just ASCII graphics in menu, packs get applied in DF and Adventurer mode.
Generate a world and export all using DFHack's **exportlegends all**

Browse your generated world in
* Legends Viewer (for Windows, requires .NET)
* Legend Browser (Java, meh)
* World Viewer (Windows and no idea)

###Pick your location
How? Read this and that or chapter XX in book for more #TODO

Start up IsoWorld and load the maps if you want better idea about starting location

Pick *safe* location using info from Legends, use search and pick your needs

Embark either carefully manually or pick one of the LNP profiles.
